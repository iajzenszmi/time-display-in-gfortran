program time_date_demo
    implicit none
    integer :: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, zone
    character(len=8) :: date_string, time_string

    ! Use date_and_time to get the current date and time
    call date_and_time(date_string, time_string, zone)

    ! Parse the date and time strings into integers
    year = int(date_string(1:4))
    month = int(date_string(5:6))
    day = int(date_string(7:8))
    hour = int(time_string(1:2))
    minute = int(time_string(3:4))
    second = int(time_string(5:6))

    ! Display the results
    print *, "Current Date:"
    print *, "Year: ", year
    print *, "Month: ", month
    print *, "Day: ", day
    print *, ""
    print *, "Current Time:"
    print *, "Hour: ", hour
    print *, "Minute: ", minute
    print *, "Second: ", second

end program time_date_demo

Explanation:

    date_and_time(date_string, time_string, zone) is used to retrieve the current date and time.
    date_string contains the date in YYYYMMDD format.
    time_string contains the time in HHMMSS format.
    The program extracts and prints the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second separately.

The error messages you're encountering are due to type mismatches and incorrect handling of the zone argument in the date_and_time subroutine. Here’s an updated version of the code that should resolve these issues:

    The zone argument should be a character variable, not an integer.
    The int intrinsic function cannot convert character substrings directly to integers, so we'll use read to convert the substrings to integers instead.

Here’s the corrected version:

program time_date_demo
    implicit none
    integer :: year, month, day, hour, minute, second
    character(len=8) :: date_string, time_string
    character(len=5) :: zone

    ! Use date_and_time to get the current date and time
    call date_and_time(date_string, time_string, zone)

    ! Convert the date and time strings into integers
    read(date_string(1:4), *) year
    read(date_string(5:6), *) month
    read(date_string(7:8), *) day
    read(time_string(1:2), *) hour
    read(time_string(3:4), *) minute
    read(time_string(5:6), *) second

    ! Display the results
    print *, "Current Date:"
    print *, "Year: ", year
    print *, "Month: ", month
    print *, "Day: ", day
    print *, ""
    print *, "Current Time:"
    print *, "Hour: ", hour
    print *, "Minute: ", minute
    print *, "Second: ", second

end program time_date_demo

Explanation of Changes:

    zone is declared as character(len=5) instead of integer.
    Each substring (e.g., date_string(1:4)) is converted to an integer using read, which is more suitable for handling character-to-integer conversions in Fortran.

Compilation

Now try compiling with the same command:

gfortran mytime.f -std=legacy -ffree-form -o mytime

This should work without errors. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!
